# InitializationExperiment
A repository to test in runtime, how performant different ways of initialising large arrays are.


### How to Run
In order to run the experiments you have to build and run them in release mode.  
The easiest way of doing it is opening the project folder in console (Or opening the Terminal in Rider/vsCode) and typing in:
```
dotnet run -c Release
```

Have fun :)
